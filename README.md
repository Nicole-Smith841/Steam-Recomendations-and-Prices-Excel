# Steam-Recomendations-and-Prices-Excel
A Statistical analysis of: Video Game (Steam) recommendations and prices. For this analysis, the importance is finding trends in the data that would lead a consumer to get both the best game at the optimal price. Overall, the data points that are significant would be: how positive the game is/was received (positive_ratio), how many users or players reviewed the game (user_reviews), the original price (price_original) the final price (price_final) and the discount (discount). Initially, looking at some of the raw data was interesting as some outliers seemed to skew the data (see below).

Using graphs, we are able to look at trends over time and to see at a glance if there is an overall trend to the data. An interesting trend became apparent with the chart following the number of ratings and the positive ratio number. According to this chart, it would seem that the more people rate a game the more positive the game tends to be.

However, looking for trends within the pricing and reviews yielded surprisingly little to no correlation. Looking at two different data comparisons, there were two separate hypotheses, one regarding positive ratio and user reviews: the null hypothesis that there is no significant relationship to the positive ratio and the user reviews and the alternative hypothesis that there is a significant relationship to the positive ratio and the user reviews. With the other comparison being for final price and positive ratio: the null hypothesis being that there is no difference for a game that receives a positive ratio and the final price vs a game that receives less than positive reviews and the alternative hypothesis being that there is a difference for a game that receives a more positive ratio and the final price vs a game that receives less than positive reviews. Calculating each of these correlation coefficients, (0.0211 and -0.0100 respectively) we find that there is little to no relationship between the respective fields. Furthermore, if we take some time and calculate the P-Vale for each, we fail to reject both of the null hypotheses presented. After calculating the data, surprisingly it would appear that the price has very little to do with the ratings and more to do with another variable not measured in the data.
